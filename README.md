To get started, youâ€™ll first need to register your bot on the Discord Developer Portal. After that, invite the bot to the Discord server where you want to use it, ensuring the bot has administrator privileges. Once the bot is set up, open "builder.exe," then paste the bot token and the guild ID of the server where you invited the bot.

If the previous steps were completed successfully, you can launch the bot by executing "Client-built.exe." This will create a new channel and post a message with a generated session number. Your bot will now be ready to use!
